# More about me

Besides working, coding and doing technical stuffs, I also care about **work-life balance and mental health**, especially during the pandemic.
No matter how talented you are, you can hardly achieve anything without good physical and mental health.

That's why I like swimming and jogging. I also like watching Marvel MCU movies, TV series (I love Spider Man and Doctor Strage most 😁 ) and listening
to music on Spotify during free time.

I'm also a gamer, who likes playing battle royale (Fortnite), tank battlefield with War Thunder and Assassin's Creed series. If you play any of those, ping me and we can play together 😁

Last but not least, I like coffee and having it with people at coffee shop (I turn coffee to code too 😁 )
