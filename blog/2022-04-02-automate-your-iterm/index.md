If you use macOS and you are a software engineer, you may know about iTerm already. Well, I won‚Äôt mention about how to use iTerm and basic features üòÅ . What I want to share is how to automate your iTerm using code.

Let‚Äôs imagine you‚Äôre developing microservices on your local machine and you want to open iTerm, run all the necessary commands to start services and tail logs. It would be fine for few services, but if you have like more than 5 and you manually click on many keys on keyboard to start them all, you will soon be tired and find it time-consuming.

Let‚Äôs dive into how to automate those steps or similar ones on iTerm step-by-step using Python!!!

## Install runtime

- On the top bar, click Scripts > Manage > New Python Script
- You will be prompted to install Python runtime environment and you should follow to install

## Create & run your first script

Once finished, try the 1st step above to create your first Python script

- iTerm will ask you types of script you want to create a template for you
- Open your script in any text editor
- For my example, I will show you how to create scripts that will create new tab and within that tab I split it into 4 panes and echo some texts

<Gist id="977e90f2475955923612f3f9c134bec0" />

- Once done, save it and head back to iTerm
- Click on Scripts and you‚Äôll see your script, then click on it

- You will notice something new on iTerm like the image below. Voila, now you finally have it, new tab with panes without so much effort in typing üòÅ
